# MineInfo (School Project)
This project is a final for my Web Design class and serves a testament to my knowledge and my superiority amongst all my other classmates.

# Hi, I'm Christian!

## About Me
I'm an amature student who likes to work on small-time projects in my spare time, and in this case, I am working on a school project!
